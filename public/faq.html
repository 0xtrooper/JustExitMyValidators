        <h2>1. What does this tool do?</h2>
        <p>
        This tool recovers your node address using your mnemonic phrase and then derives all the associated validator private keys. This functionality allows you to stop or disable a validator even if you don't have direct access to the smartnode.

        <h2>2. When should I use this tool?</h2>
        <p>
            This tool is designed for situations where you <strong>want to exit all validators</strong> and do not have access to your synced smartnode. Because it compromises all validator private keys, it should only be used if you intend to exit every validator.

    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>3. Why do I only need a mnemonic, without node access?</h2>
        <p>
        The smartnode is built on a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet architecture. This means that all private keys are derived from a single mnemonic phrase. Essentially, your mnemonic acts as a master key, allowing you to recover every validator's private key without needing direct access to the node itself.

        <h2>4. Is it secure?</h2>
        <p>
        The tool requires access to your mnemonic, which means it gains full access to your node wallet and all associated validator keys. <strong>Only your withdrawal address remains safe</strong>. 
        Additionally, to help mitigate risks, the tool is <a href="https://github.com/0xtrooper/JustExitMyValidators">open source</a> and designed to run locally, ensuring that your sensitive data remains on your own device.

        <h2>5. How do I set a withdrawl address?</h2>
        <p>
        To enhance security, <strong>it is highly recommended that you set a primary withdrawal address if you haven't already done so</strong>. You can learn how to set one by following <a href="https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/prepare-node#setting-your-primary-withdrawal-address">this guide</a>.

        <h2>6. How does it integrate with beaconcha.in?</h2>
        <p>
        The tool generates a signed exit message that you can broadcast using beaconcha.in, allowing you to start your validator's exit.
